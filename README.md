# 2048

A 2048 clone.

Use the arrow keys to move the tiles.

The game indicates when no more moves are available and allow you to reset the game.  I have not yet added a message indicating that the game has been won once a 2048 tile is made.

While debugging the program I added a method that allows the user to generate a tile by pressing the space bar.  This method has been left in the program and by used as a "cheat code".

This is my fifth Java project after completing the lessons from the MOOC Java Programming course from the University of Helsinki.
